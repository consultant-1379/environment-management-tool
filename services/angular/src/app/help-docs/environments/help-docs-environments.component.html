    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This page describes the Environments section in the Environment Management Tool.</p>
    <p>It describes what the purpose of this feature is and how it works.</p>

    <a class="anchor" name="purpose"></a>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The purpose of having an environments section in EMT is so that there can be a clear view of all environments and
        their state.</p>
    <p>It provides the user of EMT a UI which clearly displays information about each environment.</p>
    <p>Environments in EMT consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>vENM Environments</li>
        <li>Physical Environments</li>
        <li>SIENM Environments</li>
        <li>cENM Environments</li>
    </ul>

    <a class="anchor" name="environment-table"></a>
    <h3>Environment Table</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The environment tables are where the environments and the information related to each environment is displayed.
    </p>
    <p>There are three tables, one for each state an environment can be in.</p>
    <p>The tables are updated with their live status from Jenkins jobs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IDLE - the environment is free and ready to use.</li>
        <li>BUSY - the environment is currently being used, typically its running through a pipeline.</li>
        <li>QUARANTINE - the environment is in a quarantine state. For an environment to be in QUARANTINE state means
            something is wrong with the environment or something is failing e.g. Test Cases. Typically, an environment
            will be
            placed in a QUARANTINE state as a result of a failed pipeline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Change State</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>When an environment is in QUARANTINE state, to start a new pipeline you may want to move it into IDLE state.</p>
    <p>When an environment is in IDLE state, you may realize there is a problem and you want to manually set it into
        QUARANTINE.</p>
    <p>To change state:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the three buttons under Actions in the environment table</li>
        <li>Hover over environment actions</li>
        <li>Click "Change State" button</li>
    </ol>
